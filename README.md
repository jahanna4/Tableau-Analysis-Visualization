The Data Analytics department conducted an analysis of the New York Citi Bike Program to determine if there were any trends or insights that could be gleaned from the data. The scope of the analysis is all bike users during the period of April 2020 - June 2020.

##### Exploration
First, we reviewed the distribution of stations where users started their journeys and ended their journeys. The map analysis revealed that the distribution of starting stations and ending stations was fairly similar. Based on this, we can conclude that riders tend to be local meaning that they tend to ride in the same general area.

#### Analysis
Next, we analyzed the distribution of the users riding the bikes. The analysis compared average length of trips to user type. This analysis revealed that the vast majority of longer trips were taken by "Customer" users. Customer users rent bikes with either 24-hour passes or 3-day passes. It's very interesting that this group of temporary users are taking the longest rides using our bikes. After discovering this insight, we wanted to know more about this group and determine how we can reach them to encourage them to consider subscribing to our service.

Diving deeper into the data on the Customer user group, we compared the user types by age to determine if there is an age difference between Customers and Subscribers. While both user groups are represented across all ages, there is a significant spike of Customer users that were born in the year 1969. This particular demographic represents a large opportunity for converting Customers to Subscribers. After identifying this target group, we continued our analysis with the focus on locating this group for targeted marketing efforts. A distribution of users born in 1969 by type and end station revealed that the most popular end station for the target demographic is 12 Ave & W 40 St. With over 3400 check-ins of the target demographic at this station during the 3-month period, this would be the ideal location to reach the audience. Finally, we analyzed the total Customers in the target demographic at this station by hour. The purpose of this analysis was to determine what time of day the most Customers would be arriving at this station. The highest number of Customers arrive at this station during hour 16, or 4pm.

#### Conclusion
The final conclusion of our analysis is that the largest opportunity for increased Subscribers exists within the Customer segment born in the year 1969. Marketing efforts to convert this group should be targeted at the 12 Ave & W 40 St station at 4pm to reach the most riders in the target demographic after they have used the service.
